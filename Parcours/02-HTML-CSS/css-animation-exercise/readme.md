# CSS Animation drill

This is an exercise in discipline, precision and accuracy. 

In this exercise, you will build step by step a complex animation.

**Tip**: for each step of the exercise, use the images as background-image (with a slight opacity perhaps?) to help you style precisely.

```html
<div id="stage" style="background: transparent url(./images/css_animation_exercise_stage.png) 0 0 no-repeat;
```

- Create a repo `css-animation-drill`
- Create a standard index.html page
- Use the [images](./images) as your body's background image
- Create the stage. Add a div with the id "stage", style it so that it appears exactly like this image, and in the horizontal middle of your index page.

- Add a div with an id "square".
- Style the `#square` so it looks exactly like this: 

![](./images/css_animation_exercise_square.png)

Now, construct the animation step by step.
