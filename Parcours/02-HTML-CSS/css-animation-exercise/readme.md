# CSS Animation drill

**duration**: 1 day  
**team**: false  
**repo**: `css-animation-drill`


In this exercise, you will build step by step a complex animation.
This is an exercise in discipline, precision and accuracy. You will thus use a technique that could be called "the image background guide Technique". 

**Tip: the image background guide Technique**: for each step of the exercise, use the [images](./images) as your body's background image (with a slight opacity perhaps?) to help you style precisely. When done, remove the background image.

```html
<div id="stage" style="background: transparent url(./images/css_animation_exercise_stage.png) 0 0 no-repeat;">
```

- Create a standard index.html page
- Create the stage: add a div with the id "stage", style it so that it appears exactly like this image, and in the horizontal middle of your index page.

- Add a div with an id "hero".
- Style the `#hero` so it looks exactly like this:

Now, construct the animation step by step.

## Step 1
Move the hero to the right, one time.

## Step 2
Move the hero to the right, in 5 seconds, indefinitely (loop animation).
